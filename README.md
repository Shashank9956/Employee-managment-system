📋 Project Description
The Employee Management System is a robust, console-based Java application designed to streamline employee data management for small to medium-sized organizations. This project demonstrates the implementation of fundamental software engineering principles including layered architecture, data persistence, input validation, and comprehensive error handling.
Purpose: To provide a simple, efficient, and reliable solution for managing employee records without the complexity of database setup or web interfaces.
Problem Solved: Eliminates the need for manual record-keeping and provides a structured approach to employee data management with built-in validation and persistent storage.
Learning Outcomes:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
File I/O operations and serialization
Input validation and error handling
Layered software architecture design
Console-based user interface development

Layer Responsibilities

📱 UI Layer: Handles user interaction and menu navigation
⚙️ Service Layer: Implements business logic and CRUD operations
🔧 Utility Layer: Manages file operations and data persistence
📦 Model Layer: Defines data structure and employee entity

🛡️ Validation and Error Handling
Input Validation Features
Validation TypeImplementationError MessageDuplicate IDID uniqueness check"Employee ID already exists!"Salary ValidationPositive number verification"Salary must be positive!"Email FormatRegex pattern matching"Invalid email format. Please enter a valid email."Integer InputNumberFormatException handling"Invalid input. Enter a valid integer:"Menu ChoiceRange validation"Invalid choice. Try again."
Error Recovery Mechanisms

Retry Logic: Invalid inputs prompt for re-entry
File I/O Protection: Handles missing files and I/O exceptions
Data Integrity: Prevents data corruption through validation
